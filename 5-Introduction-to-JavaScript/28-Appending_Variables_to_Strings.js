// In this lesson I learned to concatenate two variables together to create a string

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "fun!"
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
