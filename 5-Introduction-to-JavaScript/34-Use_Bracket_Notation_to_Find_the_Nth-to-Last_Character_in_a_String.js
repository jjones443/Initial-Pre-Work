// In this lesson I applied the lesson learned in the previous lesson to find other characters in relation to the last
/* The resolution for second to last has me choosing index 2 which to my understanding of index numbers is that 2 would
equal the character a in Lovelace but the second to last character is actually c. I am not sure if 
I am misunderstanding the lesson or what second to last means */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
