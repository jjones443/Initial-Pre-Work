// In this lesson I learned to find characters further than the first character in a string. Remembering that string index 0 is the first character

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
